# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Spec-Driven Development Implementation Guide for Claude Code - a methodology framework providing custom slash commands for structured development workflows. It's not a traditional software project but a process framework.

## Commands

This project uses custom Claude Code slash commands located in `.claude/commands/spec/`:

- `/spec:new` - Create a new specification
- `/spec:requirements` - Generate requirements document
- `/spec:design` - Generate design document
- `/spec:tasks` - Create task list
- `/spec:approve` - Approve current phase
- `/spec:implement` - Start implementation
- `/spec:status` - Show project status
- `/spec:switch` - Switch between specs
- `/spec:update-task` - Update task completion
- `/spec:review` - Review current phase

## Development Workflow

The project enforces a four-phase sequential workflow:

1. **Requirements** → 2. **Design** → 3. **Tasks** → 4. **Implementation**

Each phase must be approved before proceeding to the next. Approval creates marker files (e.g., `.requirements-approved`).

## Project Structure

```
spec/                    # All specifications stored here
  <name>/                # Each spec has its own directory
    README.md            # Current phase document
    .requirements-approved
    .design-approved
    .tasks-approved
  .current-spec          # Tracks active specification
```

## Key Implementation Notes

- Active spec is tracked in `spec/.current-spec`
- Each command has specific tool permissions in its frontmatter
- Custom permissions configured in `.claude/settings.local.json`
- No build/test commands - this is a methodology project

## Working with Specifications

When implementing features based on a spec:
1. Check current status with `/spec:status`
2. Review the current phase document in `spec/name/README.md`
3. Follow the approved requirements, design, and task list
4. Update task completion using checkboxes or `/spec:update-task`

## Git Conventions

- Use descriptive commits: `spec: complete requirements phase`
- Each phase completion should be committed
- Keep spec documents under version control
