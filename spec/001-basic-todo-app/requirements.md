## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- App should load within 2 seconds
- Task operations should be instant (<100ms response time)

### Usability
- Simple, clean interface requiring no training
- Mobile-responsive design
- Accessible keyboard navigation

### Reliability
- Data should persist in browser local storage
- Graceful handling of storage quota exceeded
- No data loss during normal operations

## Technical Constraints

- Must work in modern browsers (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+)
- Client-side only application (no backend required)
- Use browser local storage for persistence
- Responsive design for mobile devices

## Assumptions

- Users will primarily use the app on a single device
- Tasks are personal and don't need to be shared
- Internet connectivity not required after initial load
- Users understand basic web application interactions

## Out of Scope

The following features are explicitly **not** included in this basic version:
- User authentication/accounts
- Task categories or tags
- Due dates or reminders
- Task priorities
- Multi-user collaboration
- Cloud synchronization
- Mobile app (native)
- Bulk operations
- Task search/filtering
- Data export/import

## Success Metrics

- **Functional:** All P0 requirements implemented and working
- **Usability:** User can add, complete, and delete a task within 30 seconds
- **Technical:** App loads and functions offline after first visit
- **Quality:** Zero critical bugs, graceful error handling for edge cases

## Dependencies

- Modern web browser with local storage support
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- No external libraries or frameworks required for basic version
