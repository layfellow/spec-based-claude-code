## Phase 1: Foundation Setup
*Estimated Time: 3-4 hours*

### Project Setup
- [ ] Initialize React + TypeScript project with Vite
- [ ] Configure ESLint and Prettier
- [ ] Set up basic folder structure (`src/components`, `src/services`, etc.)
- [ ] Install required dependencies (React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS)
- [ ] Create basic HTML template in `public/index.html`
- [ ] Set up Tailwind CSS configuration
- [ ] Create global styles and CSS variables
- [ ] Test development server startup (`npm run dev`)

**Dependencies:** None
**Deliverable:** Working development environment

## Phase 2: Core Features Implementation
*Estimated Time: 6-8 hours*

### Data Layer
- [ ] Create `Todo` interface in `src/types/todo.ts`
- [ ] Implement `todoService.ts` with localStorage operations
  - [ ] `loadTodos()` - Load from localStorage
  - [ ] `saveTodos()` - Save to localStorage  
  - [ ] `addTodo()` - Create new todo
  - [ ] `updateTodo()` - Update existing todo
  - [ ] `deleteTodo()` - Remove todo
- [ ] Create `useTodos.ts` custom hook for state management
- [ ] Add input validation and sanitization utilities

### UI Components
- [ ] Create main `TodoApp.tsx` component with layout
- [ ] Build `TodoForm.tsx` for adding new todos
  - [ ] Input field with proper validation
  - [ ] Add button with form submission
  - [ ] Handle empty input prevention
- [ ] Build `TodoList.tsx` for displaying todos
  - [ ] Handle empty state display
  - [ ] Render list of TodoItem components
- [ ] Build `TodoItem.tsx` for individual todos
  - [ ] Checkbox for completion toggle
  - [ ] Text display with strikethrough for completed
  - [ ] Delete button with confirmation
  - [ ] Edit functionality (inline or modal)

### Integration
- [ ] Connect TodoForm to add todo functionality
- [ ] Connect TodoList to display todos from state
- [ ] Connect TodoItem actions to state updates
- [ ] Implement localStorage persistence
- [ ] Add basic error handling for storage operations

**Dependencies:** Foundation complete
**Deliverable:** Working todo CRUD operations

---

## Phase 3: Enhancement Features
*Estimated Time: 2-3 hours*

### Statistics & Filtering
- [ ] Create `TodoStats.tsx` component showing total/completed counts
- [ ] Add "Clear Completed" functionality
- [ ] Implement basic keyboard shortcuts (Enter to submit, Escape to cancel)

### Polish & UX
- [ ] Add loading states and transitions
- [ ] Implement responsive design for mobile devices
- [ ] Add proper focus management for accessibility
- [ ] Enhance visual feedback (hover states, animations)
- [ ] Add confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- [ ] Implement proper error messages for user feedback

**Dependencies:** Core features complete
**Deliverable:** Polished, user-friendly application

---

## Phase 4: Testing & Quality Assurance
*Estimated Time: 1-2 hours*

### Testing
- [ ] Manual testing of all CRUD operations
- [ ] Test localStorage persistence across browser sessions
- [ ] Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness testing
- [ ] Accessibility testing (keyboard navigation, screen readers)

**Dependencies:** All features complete
**Deliverable:** Tested, production-ready application

## Task Dependencies

### Critical Path
1. Project Setup → Data Layer → UI Components → Integration
2. Core Features → Enhancement Features → Testing

### Parallel Development Opportunities
- UI components can be built while data layer is being implemented
- Styling and responsiveness can be done alongside feature development
- Testing can begin as soon as individual features are complete

---

## Risk Mitigation Tasks

### Data Loss Prevention
- [ ] Implement storage error handling with user notifications
- [ ] Add data backup/export functionality as JSON download
- [ ] Create storage quota monitoring with warnings

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement debounced storage saves (prevent excessive writes)
- [ ] Add performance monitoring for large todo lists (>100 items)
- [ ] Optimize re-renders with React.memo where appropriate

### Browser Compatibility
- [ ] Test localStorage availability and fallback handling
- [ ] Verify CSS Grid/Flexbox support across target browsers
- [ ] Add feature detection for critical browser APIs

### Error Handling
- [ ] Implement comprehensive error boundaries
- [ ] Add user-friendly error messages
- [ ] Create fallback UI for JavaScript disabled scenarios

---

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
- [ ] Follow React best practices (hooks, functional components)
- [ ] Maintain TypeScript strict mode compliance
- [ ] Ensure all components are properly typed
- [ ] Use consistent naming conventions
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments for complex functions

### Testing Checkpoints
After each phase, verify:
- [ ] All features work as specified in requirements
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Responsive design functions properly
- [ ] Data persists correctly in localStorage
- [ ] Application loads within performance targets (<2s)

---

## Deployment Preparation

### Build & Deploy
- [ ] Run production build (`npm run build`)
- [ ] Test production build locally (`npm run preview`)
- [ ] Optimize bundle size and verify performance
- [ ] Configure deployment to static hosting (Netlify/Vercel)
- [ ] Set up custom domain (if applicable)
- [ ] Test deployed application functionality

### Documentation
- [ ] Create README.md with setup and usage instructions
- [ ] Document any known limitations or browser requirements
- [ ] Add screenshots of the working application

---

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements Met
- [ ] All P0 requirements implemented and working
- [ ] All P1 requirements implemented (edit, visual differentiation, validation)
- [ ] At least 2 P2 requirements implemented (counter, clear completed, shortcuts)

### Quality Metrics Achieved
- [ ] Application loads in <2 seconds
- [ ] All operations respond in <100ms
- [ ] Works correctly across all target browsers
- [ ] Passes accessibility guidelines (keyboard navigation)
- [ ] Mobile responsive design functions properly

### User Experience Validated
- [ ] New user can add, complete, and delete a todo within 30 seconds
- [ ] Application works offline after initial load
- [ ] Data persists across browser sessions
- [ ] Error states provide helpful feedback
